//the origin 0 0 and travels per the following scheme. 
•	He first turns and travels 10 units of distance 
•	His second turn is upward for 20 units 
•	The third turn is to the left for 30 units 
•	The fourth turn is downward for 40 units 
•	The fifth turn is to the right(again) for 50 units 
… And thus he travels, every time increasing the travel distance by 10 units.
