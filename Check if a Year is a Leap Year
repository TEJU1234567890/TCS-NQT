// leap year or not
A leap year is:
✅ Divisible by 4
✅ Not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400

Leap Year Conditions:
2000 → Leap Year (divisible by 400)
2024 → Leap Year (divisible by 4, not by 100)
1900 → Not a Leap Year (divisible by 100, but not by 400)

((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0))
